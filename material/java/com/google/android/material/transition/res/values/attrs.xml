  <!-- Can be used in conjunction with the MaterialContainerTransform
       transition to provide a shape appearance for any arbitrary view, for the
       corner morph animation. This attribute should be set in a theme overlay
       which is then applied to the view. Useful for cases where a view has
       shaped corners but doesn't implement the Shapeable interface. -->
